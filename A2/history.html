<h2>Recap</h2>
<br />Over a two-year period in the late nineties, Townsville musicians, arts workers and a group of people who had a love for music realised the potential for developing a community-based Orchestra — one that would flourish and become an integral part of the City’s cultural life.
<br /><br />In 2000 to ‘test’ the viability of establishing an Orchestra a weekend workshop was arranged and musicians were invited to participate under the baton of Richard McIntyre, Senior Lecturer at the Canberra School of Music and the result — the Barrier Reef Orchestra was born.
<br />During the past few years, the Orchestra has performed with the comedy-duo Scared Weird Little Guys in Score, Townsville City Council’s Last Night of the Proms and A Christmas Carol. In 2003 the Council’s centenary year the Orchestra took part in Encore, as well as playing a major role in the Townsville Civic Theatre’s 25th Anniversary productions of Noye’s Fludde and Carmina Burana.
<br /><br />In a typical year the Barrier Reef Orchestra, under the auspices of North Queensland Ensembles Inc, performs three times generally with a guest conductor and occasionally with other performing groups. Smaller ensembles, all utilising players from the Orchestra, regularly give concerts — Orpheus Strings, Pandanus Winds, Kingfisher Trio, Centenary Concert Band and the Barrier Reef Chamber Orchestra. In 2004, the Orchestra presented its first subscription series of three concerts receiving sponsorship from Queensland Nickel – Yabulu.
<br /><br />The high standard is due in no small measure to the guidance and inspiration of our founding Patron, Professor John Hopkins OBE and conductor Richard McIntyre OAM.
<br /><br />In 2006 the orchestra became a truly North Queensland orchestra when in March a number of string players from Cairns travelled to Townsville to rehearse under Professor Hopkins for the planned Tchaikovsky concert. Unfortunately, the interruption of Cyclone Larry prevented the repeat performance scheduled for Cairns.
<br /><br />The final concert for 2006 , ‘Amadeus’, celebrated the life of this great composer in his 250th anniversary year. The Barrier Reef Orchestra could think of no better way in which to celebrate their sixth anniversary!

<h2>2007</h2>
<p>In 2007 BRO performed the Beethoven Triple Concerto with visiting Seraphim Trio from Melbourne. The orchestra repeated the concert in Cairns with no Cyclone Larry this time!</p>

<h2>2008</h2>
<p>In 2008 this last concert generated an award from the Townsville City Council as "Best Musical Event 2007" and after a mammoth launch at the Townsville City CouncilChambers the year began with a concert under the baton of visiting UK conductor Mark Eager. This was a collaboration with a combined High Schools orchestra and demonstrated the depth of musical talent flowing up from the district's excellent Instrumental Music programs. The concert culminated in BRO combining with the high school orchestra for a stirring 1812 Overture!</p>

<h2>2010</h2>
<p>As promised, Ji Won Kim duly performed in our March Concert Romantic Interludes at the Riverway Arts Centre. This well attended concert featured Beethoven Violin Concerto with Ji Won giving a stunning performance. The concert also included Schubert’s Rosamunde Overture and the “unfinished” Symphony No. 8 by Schubert. Conductor was Professor John Hopkins. </p>

<h2>2011</h2>
<p>We have had a notable and rewarding year which saw the Orchestra include other arts groups to great advantage – three choirs, 1RAR Band and Townsville Cinema Group were all involved with us this year. The three concerts attracted a total of 1,457 patrons and two were full houses.</p>

<h2>2012</h2>
<p>2012 was a very successful year for the orchestra. We presented three concerts, one at Riverway Arts Centre and two at the Civic Theatre. Each was well received and well patronized – a total of 1,434 patrons between the three concerts. Not only is our audience increasing but so also is the orchestra itself – we have many new players and numbered 65 or more musicians on stage at each concert. Our general membership is also increasing and perhaps reflecting this trend (and the increasing workload) we now have an enthusiastic management committee that is twelve strong.</p>

<h2>2013</h2>
<p>In 2013 we staged three  successful concerts with a total audience of 1200 patrons.  In March the  “Works of Art” concert was a sellout at Riverway.  Mussorgsky, Strauss  and Haydn with conductor Mario Dobernig was well  received by an appreciative audience.</p>

<h2>2014</h2>
<p>I would like to thank all the players who together produced such excellent performances in 2013.   Our audience is growing and the quality of our concerts is certainly one of the reasons for this.   I would also like to acknowledge the hard working committee who do so much behind the scenes.</p>
