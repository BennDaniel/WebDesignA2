<br /><br />2013 saw our first encouragement awards.   Two young orchestra members – Craig Land and Lexie Gorton – each received a well deserved $500 award in recognition of their enthusiastic participation in the orchestra and their musical development.   I am pleased that the committee is continuing the encouragement awards in 2014.
<br /><br />I would like to thank all the players who together produced such excellent performances in 2013.   Our audience is growing and the quality of our concerts is certainly one of the reasons for this.   I would also like to acknowledge the hard working committee who do so much behind the scenes.  Particular thanks are due to Alan Nixon who is now retiring after seven years as Secretary and to Annette Ellis who has been Treasurer for seven years and is continuing in that position.  Special mention must also be made of Stephen Frewen-Lord’s continuing role as Concert Master and the tireless efforts of several rehearsal conductors.
<br /><br />As I am now retiring as President this is my last report.  Over the last five years it has been gratifying to see the Barrier Reef Orchestra make considerable progress.   In 2009 the orchestra was in the doldrums.  It was drawing an audience of 150 or less, had less than $10,000 in cash reserves and performed as an orchestra of about 40 players.  In fact the mid year concert in 2009 was cancelled because we simply could not muster the players required for the concert program.   We are now drawing a audience of 300 to 400 if not more, have cash reserves around $70,000 and field an orchestra of 60 to 70 players, depending on the program.   We have also had a paid manager for several years and our current manager Sally Frewen-Lord has achieved organisational wonders.  This transformation has occurred only because of the great effort that has been put in over years by managers, members both playing and non-playing, by committee members and by sponsors, supporters and philanthropists, so it is very much a team effort.
<br /><br />I am confident that this enthusiasm and support will continue under Andrew Ryder’s presidency and the orchestra will retain and enhance its position as one of the leading organizations in Townsville’s arts community.
