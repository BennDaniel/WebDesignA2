<br /><br /><strong>2013</strong>
<br />In 2013 we staged three  successful concerts with a total audience of 1200 patrons.  In March the  “Works of Art” concert was a sellout at Riverway.  Mussorgsky, Strauss  and Haydn with conductor Mario Dobernig was well  received by an appreciative audience.
<br />In August we had the well named  “Contrasts” concert with conductor Raymond Yong and a program varying  from Beethoven to Sculthorpe and featuring Elgar’s Cello Concerto with  Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition winner  Yoshika Masuda.   This concert was also presented at the Burdekin  Theatre, our first performance at another centre for many years.   The  concert was also notable for our collaboration with Umbrella Studio and  ABC Open which resulted in a photo artists group  forming to produce a video of images to accompany Schulthorpe’s Mangrove.
<br />We provided an ensemble to play  at Anzac Park in September as part of the Bandstand Centenary event and  then in October we presented Hats off to Gilbert and Sullivan.   This was a quite demanding  production devised and conducted by Richard McIntyre and involved 80  singers from North Queensland Opera and Music Theatre and Townsville  Choral Society.  The chorus combined with a sizable  orchestra well and truly filled the Civic stage for what was  essentially a Gilbert and Sullivan tribute show featuring excerpts from  three operettas tied together by a narrator.<
<br />2013 saw us maintain our  membership numbers and our financial position remained strong.  We cover  approximately 60% of our expenditure from box office income (which is  considered to be very good by not-for-profit arts  organisation standards) and the remainder is covered by grants,  sponsorship and philanthropy.
<br />Townsville City Council  continues to be our principal sponsor with a generous grant that covers  our on-going core operational expenses.   The Wheeler Family Charitable  Gift Fund has also continued its strong support and  it was pleasing to welcome Wilmar Sugar as a new sponsor in 2013.   Wilmar are supporting us in our Burdekin performance initiative.   Great  in-kind support has continued from Sturt Business Centre, ASAP  Printers, Signs of Excellence and the Australian Concerto  and Vocal Competition.
<br />A new fund raising approach in  2013 was our Benefactors appeal.  This has had a good start with 17  benefactors currently enrolled and the first renewals about to  commence.   I believe this particular avenue of fund raising  will strengthen over time and prove to be a very reliable source of  income provided it is proactively managed.
<br />2013 saw our first encouragement  awards.   Two young orchestra members – Craig Land and Lexie Gorton –  each received a well deserved $500 award in recognition of their  enthusiastic participation in the orchestra and their  musical development.   I am pleased that the committee is continuing  the encouragement awards in 2014.</span>
